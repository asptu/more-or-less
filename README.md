# Discord More or Less (Higher or Lower)

![](https://imgur.com/a/HpqIkUX)

Based off of http://www.higherlowergame.com/ Discord More or Less essentially just ports the experience to your server with a couple of commands to set everything off

Probably one of my most elaborate stupid discord games

## Requirements

- **Pycord** (pip install -U py-cord)
- **BeautifulSoup4** (pip install beautifulsoup4)
- **dotenv** (pip install python-dotenv)
- **requests** (pip install requests)
- **Pillow** (pip install Pillow)

## Planned Features

- [x] $next command so you dont keep $start(ing) it
- [x] Fix comparing results as sometimes smaller values are treated as larger?
- [x] Make a proper embed (also wip)
- [x] Make a countdown timer (pretty sketch, need to make better)
- [x] Add double points command
- [x] Relatively optimised
