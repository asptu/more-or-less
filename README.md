# Discord More or Less (Higher or Lower) WIP

Based off of http://www.higherlowergame.com/ Discord More or Less essentially just ports the experience to your server with a couple of commands to set everything off

Probably one of my most elaborate stupid discord games

## Requirements

- **Pycord** (pip install -U py-cord)
- **BeautifulSoup4** (pip install beautifulsoup4)
- **dotenv** (pip install python-dotenv)

## Planned Features

- $next command so you dont keep $start(ing) it
- Fix comparing results as sometimes smaller values are treated as larger?
- Make a proper embed
- Make a countdown timer
- Add double points command
- OPTIMISE THE HELL OUT OF THIS ONE
